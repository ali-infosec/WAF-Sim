# WAF-Sim
# WAF Simulation Project (ModSecurity + OWASP CRS + DVWA)  This project demonstrates how to set up a local Web Application Firewall using ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) on Kali Linux, paired with Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). The simulation captures and logs common web attacks and rule triggers for security analysis.
